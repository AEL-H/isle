list of stylised facts:
    >60% of categories reinsured + realistic number of reinsurers
    huge bottleneck with ???
    insurance is close to maximum capacity, most of the time
    reinsurers were not defaulting
  **unbalanced insurers, or unbalanced reinsurers, want both balanced
    more risk models, lower premium, more contracts underwritten, less bankruptcies
    what should happen after total collapse of the insurance or reinsurance market?
    insurance cycle --oscillating premium (currently sawtooth, we want sinusoidal)
    insurance simulation ends up at lower bound premium sometimes, should never happen
    more insurers than reinsurers (if paper is correct at least 4x more) but otherwise 8x-10x probably more
    havent  been using catbonds yet, but we have very good data, 25% of insurance market is insured by catbonds (its in the document)
    profits/losses timeseries -- potentially something here
    powerlaw distribution in the timesteps (heavy tailed positive (left skewed)) for both insurance and reinsurance firms

AWS:
    acct
    potentially remove the jit decorators + numba

stepsize:
    limited to 1000 atm, potentially up to 1500
    want larger agent size, 

profile how effective numba is:
    change steps from 10, 100, 1000, 10000,
    change number of agents from 10, 100, 1000

calibration:
    
visualisation:
    pie chart for insurers
    show distribution + median per timestep
    ensemble statistics + visualisations
    cumulative of defaults is in github, we want the proportion of cumulative defaults relative to the cumulative of total firms
